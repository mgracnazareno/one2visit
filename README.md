# One2Visit

**One2Visit** is a static website that showcases fun and exciting activities around Montreal. It helps both locals and visitors discover attractions, events, and experiences through a clean, organized, and responsive layout.

## 🛠 Background

This project was originally a task for the **Digital Clinic program at Centre Inicio**, where participants were asked to build a website using Google Sites or Wix. Instead of using those platforms, I chose to develop the site entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to better demonstrate my web development skills and include it in my portfolio.

## 🔍 Features

- Fully static website  
- Category-based activity filtering using JavaScript  
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap 5  
- Minimalist and user-friendly design  

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Bootstrap 5  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
